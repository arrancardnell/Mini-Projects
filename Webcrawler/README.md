Webcrawler

Enter the web address you would like to crawl.

If you would like to save the output of the crawler, select yes on request and give the output file a name of your choice. The
file will be saved to the desktop in a folder of the same name.

If you don't want to save the output of the crawler, select no. The output will be displayed to the console only.

The crawler will return the title, url and outgoing links on every page of the chosen website. The webcrawler will list 
external sites, but will not crawl to them.
